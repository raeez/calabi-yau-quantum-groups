# CLAUDE.md -- Volume III: CY Categories, Quantum Groups, and BPS Algebras

**Canonical reference for all shared content: ~/chiral-bar-cobar/CLAUDE.md. This file contains ONLY Vol III-specific material.**

## Identity

Volume III constructs the geometric source: the functor Phi: CY_d-Cat -> E_2-ChirAlg providing input data for the Vols I-II bar-cobar machine. Flow: CY category -> chiral algebra -> bar complex -> modular characteristic -> partition function.

~206pp, this repo, 17,199 tests. Five parts: I(CY Engine) II(CY Characteristic Datum) III(CY Landscape) IV(Seven Faces of r_CY(z)) V(CY Frontier).

**5 genuine stub chapters** (<50 lines, AP114): quantum_groups_foundations (24), derived_categories_cy (27), geometric_langlands (28), matrix_factorizations (29), modular_koszul_bridge (13). Develop or comment out. **3 thin chapters** (50-100 lines, may need development): cyclic_ainf (55), cy_categories (70), e1_chiral_algebras (90). **5 formerly listed stubs now developed** (>300 lines): hochschild_calculus, braided_factorization, drinfeld_center, fukaya_categories, quantum_group_reps.

## Main Theorems

| Theorem | Status | Notes |
|---------|--------|-------|
| **CY-A** (CY-to-chiral functor) | d=2 PROVED; d=3 PROGRAMME | d=3 conditional on chain-level S^3-framing |
| **CY-B** (E_2-chiral Koszul duality) | PROGRAMME | Depends on CY-A |
| **CY-C** (Quantum group realization) | CONJECTURAL | C(g,q) not constructed. Uses \begin{conjecture}. NEVER \begin{theorem} |
| **CY-D** (Modular CY characteristic) | PROGRAMME | kappa well-defined only when A_C exists |

## The kappa-Spectrum (AP113, CRITICAL)

Bare "kappa" is FORBIDDEN in Vol III. A CY manifold gives rise to MULTIPLE chiral algebraizations, each with its own kappa. ALWAYS subscript:

| Subscript | Meaning | K3 x E value |
|-----------|---------|--------------|
| kappa_ch | From chiral algebra A_C via Phi | 3 |
| kappa_BKM | From Borcherds-Kac-Moody algebra | 5 (weight of Delta_5) |
| kappa_cat | From categorical/holomorphic Euler char | 2 = chi(O_{K3}) |
| kappa_fiber | From lattice/fiber structure | 24 (lattice rank) |

kappa(K3 x E) = 3 vs 5 contradiction arose from conflating kappa_ch and kappa_BKM. Full spectrum: {2,3,5,24}.

## E_1/E_2 Chiral Hierarchy

E_1-chiral (Vol II): associative factorization on C x R. Monoidal rep categories. E_2-chiral (this vol): braided factorization on C x C. Braided monoidal rep categories: habitat of quantum groups. E_1 -> E_2 via Dunn additivity. d=2: S^2-framing of HH_*(C) gives E_2. d=3: holomorphic CS breaks E_2 to E_1; recover E_2 via Drinfeld center Z(Rep^{E_1}(A)) = Rep^{E_2}(Z^der_ch(A)). Drinfeld center is categorified av: E_1-Cat -> E_2-Cat. Quantum groups, Yangians, braided tensor categories natively E_1. E_2 derived.

## CY-Specific Anti-Patterns (AP-CY1 through AP-CY8)

AP-CY1: CY dimension d != complex dimension n. Fuk(X) is CY_n, D^b(Coh(X)) is CY_n. Not real dim 2n.
AP-CY2: CY trace is in HC^-_d(C), NOT just HH_d -> k. Negative cyclic refinement essential for S^d-framing.
AP-CY3: E_2 != commutative. E_2 braiding is NOT symmetric. E_2 -> E_inf loses quantum group structure.
AP-CY4: Drinfeld center Z(C) (monoidal category) != derived center Z^der_ch(A) (chiral). State which.
AP-CY5: Kazhdan-Lusztig requires root of unity. Generic q: Rep_q(g) semisimple.
AP-CY6: A_X for CY3 does NOT exist. It IS the d=3 programme. NEVER write as if defined. **Strengthened**: any result whose proof chain passes through A_X at d=3 MUST carry \ClaimStatusConditional and explicitly name CY-A_3 as dependency. Conditionality PROPAGATES through all downstream results.
AP-CY7: CoHA != E_1-chiral algebra. CoHA is associative. "E_1-sector of G(X)" assumes G(X) exists (AP43).
AP-CY8: Borcherds denominator != bar Euler product. Identification requires CY-to-chiral functor. For K3 x E: observation, not theorem.

### Empirical (AP-CY9-13, from 50-commit error archaeology)
AP-CY9: Jacobi form discriminant constraint. For phi_{k,m} of index m, only discriminants D with D=0 or D=3 mod 4 (m=1) can appear. NEVER fill coefficient table with sequential D-values. Verify discriminant constraint. c(-1)=2 for phi_{0,1} in EZ convention, NOT 1.
AP-CY10: Flop != Koszul dual. Birational flop X->X^+ is derived equivalence PRESERVING kappa. Koszul dual A^! has kappa(A)+kappa(A^!)=rho_K. Flop exchanges chambers; Koszul exchanges algebra/coalgebra. kappa(A_X)=kappa(A_{X+}) for flop, NOT kappa(A_X)+kappa(A_{X+})=0.
AP-CY11: Conditional d=3 transitivity. If Result B depends on Result A which depends on CY-A_3, then B is ALSO conditional on CY-A_3. Use \ClaimStatusConditional and state the dependency chain. DEFAULT environment for new Vol III formal statements is \begin{conjecture} unless proof is COMPLETE and UNCONDITIONAL.
AP-CY12: Shadow class from full computation. G/L/C/M must be determined by computing full shadow tower, NOT by counting generators. Non-formality (m_3!=0) does NOT by itself determine shadow depth. local P^2 is class M (infinite depth), not class L.
AP-CY13: Cross-volume Part number staleness. After ANY Part restructuring in ANY volume, grep ALL THREE volumes for stale Part references. Part numbers are the most fragile cross-reference. Use \ref{part:...} exclusively, never hardcode. **Strengthened**: run grep -rn 'Part~[IVXL]' chapters/ notes/ and verify EVERY match. 7+ stale refs survived a single restructuring.

### Deep Empirical (AP-CY14-19, from 100-commit deep archaeology)
AP-CY14: Unconstructed object inhabits theorem environment. ANY statement whose proof chain passes through G(X) at d=3, A_{K3xE}, or any unconstructed object MUST use \begin{conjecture}, NEVER \begin{theorem}/\begin{proposition}. The LLM pattern-matches on logical structure ("if X then Y") without checking whether X exists. 11+ instances fixed across 4 commits. DEFAULT in Vol III is \begin{conjecture}.
AP-CY15: README scope inflation beyond .tex ground truth. README must not claim "verified" or "proved" for structural analogies or pattern matches. The README accumulates stronger claims than the .tex supports because the LLM optimizes for impressiveness. After README edits, verify every "proved"/"verified" against corresponding \ClaimStatus tag.
AP-CY16: Matrix size conflation in group quotients. Sp_4 quotient by +/-I_4 (4x4), NOT +/-I_5. O(Lambda^{3,2}) quotient by +/-I_5 (5x5). When two groups of different rank appear in the same formula, the LLM harmonizes subscripts to whichever appears more frequently.
AP-CY17: MF(W) CY dimension is n-2, NOT n-1. For W: A^n -> A^1, MF(W) is CY_{n-2} (Dyckerhoff). ADE in 2 variables: CY_0 (semisimple). Need 4 variables for CY_2. The n-1 vs n-2 error changes which families are CY_2.
AP-CY18: Lattice theta series comparison. Verify q-power divergence by DIRECT COMPUTATION. Leech theta: minimum norm^2=4, first correction at q^2 not q^1. The match with 1/eta^24 extends through q^1. Never conflate j(tau) coefficients with V_Lambda character coefficients.
AP-CY19: A-hat genus argument halving. A-hat(x) = (x/2)/sinh(x/2). Convergence radius = 2*pi (first pole of sin(x/2) at x=2*pi). NEVER drop the /2 in the argument, which gives spurious radius pi. Appeared in 3+ independent computations.

## Session Entry (Vol III additions)

1. Read ~/chiral-bar-cobar/CLAUDE.md first (canonical).
2. Then this file (kappa-spectrum, AP-CY1-8).
3. Check AP113: bare kappa -> subscripted kappa_{ch,BKM,cat,fiber}.
4. Check AP114: do not cite theorems from 12 stub chapters.
5. CY-A: d=2 PROVED, d=3 PROGRAMME. Scope EVERY CY-A claim by dimension.
6. CY-C is CONJECTURE. NEVER \begin{theorem} for CY-C (AP40).
